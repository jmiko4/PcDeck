# Community showcase

This is a showcase of `deej` versions built by people around the world. If you built yourself one of these things, I'd love to [add yours](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu)! Either open a PR or contact me on Discord.

This build features a very neat 3D-printed enclosure to fit the sliders, and uses an Arduino Nano board.

This build uses circular knobs instead of sliders, and adds a 7-segment display showing the volume of the last adjusted knob. It also adds functionality to allow designating a knob to control the volume of whichever application is currently in focus. Those changes are available in Bupher's fork (link above). Very cool!
